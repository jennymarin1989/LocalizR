Welcome to the repo for our final project at Makers Academy! Our application is an interactive game that takes the user on a language-learning journey. The user can pick a language presented with multiple questions, each answer will add points and the total score will be display at the end.

## Final Thoughts

Our approach to the final project was initially the creation of a Minimum Viable Product(MVP), using User Stories and diagrams as a guide of the product requirements folowing the Agile methodology and implementing good practices like Test Driven Development using testing frameworks like Jest and cyprus. 
Althought we weren't able to finish the project, I learnt the basics of React, node and MongoDB, If given more time, We would have continue implementing TDD in new features added in the project and we would have created a new database to hold all the information of questions and scenarios.
Next time, in the execution of a project, I will keep the good standards of code applying TDD in all the steps of the project.
